# DJI Mini UAV Image Dataset

## Overview

This dataset consists of images and corresponding labels collected using a DJI Mini UAV. It includes images extracted from 15 videos captured at altitudes of 10 and 14 meters, with every 30th frame being selected. This dataset is a blend of publicly available Manipal data and data collected during our research, aimed at enhancing the understanding of aerial imagery analysis.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into the following directories:

- `DJI_0965` to `DJI_0971`: Each folder contains images captured from different segments of the videos.
- `images`: Contains all extracted images.
- `images_labels`: Includes image-label pairs for training and evaluation.
- `labels`: Contains the annotation files for the images.

## Usage

This dataset is intended for research purposes, particularly in the field of image processing and machine learning. Researchers can utilize the images and labels for tasks such as object detection, classification, and segmentation.

## How to Access

To access the dataset, you can download the zipped files from the repository. Unzip the files to obtain the dataset folders and files.

## Additional Information

The images were captured at specific intervals (every 30th frame) to ensure a diverse representation of the captured environment. This dataset is designed to support research in aerial imagery, enabling advancements in algorithms for image analysis.
